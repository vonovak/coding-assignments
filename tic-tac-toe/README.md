## Piskvorky
Pi≈°kvorky is a tic-tac-toe-like game where the goal is to get 5 or more symbols of one kind in a row (in any direction). 
This is an implementation of the game for two human players as I developed it for the final project of the Programming 1 course. It is written and tested in Java 1.6 under Windows and the GUI uses Swing and AWT.

Using the program is simple, you can test it out by running the `jar` file.
